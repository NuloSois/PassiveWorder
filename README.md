Simple System to set passwords for code execution, using only basic conditionals and variables

How to use:

Set the desired password between the quotes in the if statement on line 14, as shown in the image below

Set the code you want on the curly braces below the if conditional

Set the code you want to show if the password is wrong below the else conditional

You can further enhance the code by putting else if statements between the if and else statements for adding aditional passwords to other codes you might want,
for example, you can add a password for teachers on "if" and a password for students on "else if" so you can use the same program for both teachers and students.
